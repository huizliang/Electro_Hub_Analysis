# Company Background
Founded in 2018, Elist is an e-commerce company that sells popular electronics products and has since expanded to a global customer base. Like most e-commerce companies, Elist sells products through their online site as well as through their mobile app. They use a variety of marketing channels to reach customers, including Email campaigns, SEO, and affiliate links. Over the last few years, their more popular products have been products from Apple, Samsung, and ThinkPad.

# Overview

From 2019 - 2022, Elist generated a total of $28M in sales and 108K  in orders. In the span of 4 years, overall sales and order count also increased by 28%. A significant portion of the sales derived from 2020 where the onset of the pandemic drove consumers to pivot their purchasing habits from in-person to online-ordering, resulting in $6M in sales for the company. In 2021-2022 however, figures trended downwards for sales -(46%), average order value (-10%), and order count (-40%). Finding ways to maintain the value captured from 2020-2021 would be essential for Elist to sustain long-term growth.
